## The Instructions for Completing The ILP Portfolio Website Shell

**Create a shell of your ILP site. Please know that this is separate from your weekly learning journal/blog. This will be a long-term project that is graded toward the end of the program in CST 499 Capstone.**

**Your homepage must contain:**

-   CSUMB logo (available here:  [https://csumb.edu/communications/logo](https://csumb.edu/communications/logo))
-   Your name with a short bio, description of the program (outcomes), and your goals
-   Professional photo of you (optional)

**Links/tabs to each term/class (Review your ILP to be sure you include each course):**

-   For now, please just make sure you have a page created for each course. **You will be responsible for updating these pages as you progress through the program**. You should have each page except 499 filled out by the time you reach Capstone.  **Professors usually will not remind you, so be sure to populate your pages as you go**. As you finish each course, the page should contain:  
    -   Course description (all descriptions available here:  [https://csumb.edu/catalog/info-tech-communications-design-courses](https://csumb.edu/catalog/info-tech-communications-design-courses))
    -   Your final project for the class  
          
        
-   **For CST 300, please add:**
    -   Course description
    -   Your Industry Analysis paper
    -   (Optional) Anything else you would like to include that you have worked on in the course

**You are free to use any web service**  you are comfortable with (Google Sites, Weebly, Wix, etc. or CSUMB hosting for hand-coded sites),  **but we recommend Weebly**  for its ease of use and archiving abilities. 

*(Is using GitHub Pages too much?)*
